# Symmetric and self-adjoint real matrix vocabulary

This file keeps the real square-matrix vocabulary thin. `IsSymmetricMatrix`
wraps Mathlib's transpose equality `Matrix.IsSymm`, while
`IsSelfAdjointMatrix` wraps Mathlib's Hermitian/self-adjoint matrix predicate.
For the current real-valued branch these are kept as separate names so future
complex Hermitian work does not silently change theorem statements.

Real square matrix symmetry, backed by Mathlib `Matrix.IsSymm`.

Formula reference: in finite dimensions, self-adjoint/Hermitian structure is
represented by equality to the adjoint; over real matrices this aligns with
symmetry. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator

Real square matrix self-adjointness, backed by Mathlib `Matrix.IsHermitian`.

Formula reference: a self-adjoint operator is equal to its adjoint; in finite
matrix form this is the Hermitian condition. See
