# Canonical Rademacher variable

This file provides the minimal distribution-level atom needed before finite
Rademacher-sum and Hoeffding-style stages: the symmetric Rademacher variable on
`Bool`, with the uniform Bernoulli measure.

The symmetric Bernoulli PMF on `Bool`.

Formula reference: the Rademacher distribution assigns probability `1 / 2`
to each of `-1` and `+1`; see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution

def rademacherPMF : PMF Bool :=
  PMF.bernoulli (1 / 2 : NNReal) (by norm_num)

/--
The canonical probability measure for a symmetric Rademacher variable.

Formula reference: this is the measure-level version of the symmetric
two-point mass function on `{ -1, +1 }`; see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution
-/
def rademacherMeasure : Measure Bool :=
  rademacherPMF.toMeasure

/--
Formula reference: the Rademacher PMF has total mass `1`, giving a probability
measure; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution

/--
The canonical Rademacher random variable on `Bool`: `true -> 1`, `false -> -1`.

Formula reference: a Rademacher variate takes values `+1` and `-1` with equal
probability; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution
-/
def rademacher : RealRandomVariable Bool :=
  fun b => if b then (1 : Real) else -1

/--
The canonical Rademacher variable is measurable.

Formula reference: measurability is the Lean-side random-variable condition
for the two-point Rademacher variate described at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution

/--
The canonical Rademacher variable is pointwise contained in `[-1, 1]`.

Formula reference: the support is exactly `{ -1, +1 }`, hence lies in
`[-1, 1]`; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_distribution

The canonical Rademacher variable has mean zero.

Formula reference: Wikipedia lists the Rademacher mean as `0`; see

/--
The canonical symmetric Rademacher variable is centered subGaussian in the MGF
sense with scale `1`.

This uses Mathlib's bounded zero-mean MGF lemma with interval `[-1, 1]`.

Formula reference: Wikipedia lists the Rademacher MGF as `cosh(t)` and records
Rademacher-sum concentration inequalities; see

The canonical Rademacher variable satisfies the existing two-sided
subGaussian-tail predicate with scale `2`, by composition through the MGF
bridge.

Formula reference: Rademacher variables are the canonical bounded signs used
in Rademacher-sum concentration bounds; see
