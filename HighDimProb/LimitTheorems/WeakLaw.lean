# Weak law of large numbers statement layer

This module records typed weak-law targets backed by the current sample-mean,
tail, variance, and convergence-in-measure vocabulary. The statements are
specifications only; independence, iid, and variance-of-sum infrastructure are
not available yet.

Typed target for the Chebyshev route to a finite-variance weak law.

Formula reference: this records the Chebyshev-style finite-sample bound
`P(|sampleMean - mu| >= eps) <= sigmaSq / (n * eps^2)`; see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality

The hypotheses are intentionally explicit proof obligations: future stages
should prove the displayed bound from finite variance plus independence and
covariance assumptions, rather than fake iid infrastructure here.

Typed target for finite-variance weak convergence in probability of sample means.

Formula reference: the weak law asserts convergence in probability of sample
means to the mean under suitable independence/finite-variance hypotheses; see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers

This uses Mathlib's `TendstoInMeasure` as the current convergence-in-probability
vocabulary. A proof is deferred until the project has sequence-level sample
families, independence/iid wrappers, and variance-of-sum facts.
