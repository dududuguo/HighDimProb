# Expectation

HighDimProb uses Mathlib integral notation for expectations. The alias in this file is only a
lightweight ergonomic wrapper for real-valued random variables.

Expectation of a real-valued random variable, as a Mathlib integral.

Formula reference: expectation is represented as an integral,
`E[X] = integral X dP`; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value
