# Layer-cake and exponential-tail calculus helpers

This module is the public import boundary for reusable layer-cake and
tail-integral infrastructure.

For Stage C1 the existing declarations are re-exported from
`HighDimProb.Concentration.TailToOrlicz` to keep names stable and avoid a risky
physical move of proof-heavy analytic lemmas. Future cleanup can move the
declaration bodies here without changing public theorem names.

Formula reference: the re-exported lemmas formalize the layer-cake identity
that rewrites nonnegative functions and integrals through super-level-set
tails, as summarized at
