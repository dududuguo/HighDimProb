/--
An event on a measurable space, represented by a set.

Formula reference: in a probability space `(Omega, F, P)`, events are subsets
of the sample space belonging to the event space; see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space

abbrev Event (Ω : Type*) [MeasurableSpace Ω] := Set Ω

/--
A measurable event on a measurable space.

Formula reference: this corresponds to membership in the event sigma-algebra
`F` of a probability space `(Omega, F, P)`; see
